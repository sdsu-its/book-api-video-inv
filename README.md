This file file serves as your book's preface, a great place to describe your book's content and ideas.



### Global Variables

In the API documentation, several "global" variables will be used to simplify the documentation, and make it more applicable to your use case.

* `API_ROOT` - The URL of the api folder in your instance of the Video Inventory Management System. If you are deploying to a default Tomcat container with the default context, the URL would be `http://localhost:8080/video_inv`.
* `SESSION_TOKEN` - After the Login process is completed, all requests need to include the Session Token, which is obtained during the authentication process. This is that token.
* `success` - the jQuery function that is executed once the request is successful.
